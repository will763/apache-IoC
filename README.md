  In this project I created a script where a web server will
be automatically provisioned. A web server is software and
hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other
protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. 
The main job of a web server is to display website content by storing, processing and delivering web pages to users.
